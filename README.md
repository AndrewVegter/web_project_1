# Web Project 1
## Learning How to Learn

This project was made with the goal that anyone with half a brain can scroll through down the page clicking links, watching videos, and reading lists while hopefully becoming a better student of **everything**. Now, I know what you're thinking, because I'm thinking it, too. How can one *learn* how to *learn* if they have not first __*learned how to learn?*__ Unfortunately, I don't have an answer. But, maybe after utilizing this webpage, and studying rigourously, you'll be able to tell me ;)!

### This webpage consists of:
  * Lists of diverse strategies, from the **galaxy** brains of Richard Feynman, Barbara Oakley, and Josh Kaufman.
  * Useful resouces, from YouTube videos, to links to external (and possibly forbidden?) knowledge.
  * Pictures of things for those of us who can't stare at words for too long without going crosseyed.
  * __*ROTATING SHAPES*__! I mean, who doesn't love those? Bonus points if you can name the shapes!

### This webpage was made using
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * Some iframes, lots of links, countless paragraphs, a keyframe animation, several flex-boxes, a few unordered lists, and ~~many, many tears...~~

### This webpage should function well on recent versions of:
  * Chrome
  * Firefox
  * Safari
  * God forbid, Opera? I've never even met anyone who uses Opera.. ~~Why Opera?~~ You know what, nevermind.
  * IE (Hi, Grandma!)
  * Edge 
  
### Possible changes:
  * Adjusting the position of the rotating blue triangle because for whatever reason in the project 2 brief the position has seemingly shifted down with no explanation given.
  * Adding a new section with some resources that I personally found useful or interesting. Such as [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBVV8pch1dM&t=1s&ab_channel=Veritasium).
